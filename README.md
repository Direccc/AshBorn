# AshBorn

AshBorn is a project website for a professional gaming organization, created as part of a school project. Our team represents multiple games and has a dedicated fanbase. This site serves as an introduction to AshBorn, showcasing our mission, the games we’re involved in, and an exclusive merchandise shop.

## Features

- **Landing Page**  
  The landing page introduces AshBorn with key information:
  - **Organization Timeline**: Explore the history of AshBorn, from its foundation to its current standing in the gaming community.
  - **Games**: Highlights of the games in which our teams compete.
  - **Merch Shop**: A preview of AshBorn merchandise created for team fans.
  
- **CRUD Operations for Merch**  
  A basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system supports the management of merchandise, allowing for easy additions, modifications, and deletions of products in the shop.

## Tech Stack

This project uses:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP, MySQL

## Setup and Installation

No specific requirements for setup—just run it on any server or localhost environment that supports PHP and MySQL. Please note that *AshBorn* is not responsive, as it was developed during our first year of college.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AshBorn.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AshBorn
   ```

3. Open the main HTML file in your browser to view the site locally:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

Alternatively, you can drag the `index.html` file into your web browser to view it.

## Usage Notes

- **Improvement Areas**: While the site is fully functional, there’s significant potential for enhancing the merch shop into a fully-featured e-commerce platform. This would include expanding inventory management and payment processing options tailored for AshBorn team merchandise.

## Visuals

The *AshBorn* logo is featured on the landing page, along with a timeline illustrating the organization’s journey.

## Future Plans

This project was designed specifically for a school assignment, so no further updates are currently planned. However, contributions are welcome, especially in expanding the e-commerce functionality.
